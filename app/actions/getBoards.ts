/* 
The updated code you provided retrieves active boards with additional sorting and
 includes related data. Here's a breakdown:

Sorting:

orderBy: { updatedAt: "desc" } sorts the retrieved boards in descending order based
 on their updatedAt timestamp. This means you'll get the most recently updated boards first.
Includes:

include: { lists: { include: { cards: true } } } fetches related lists associated 
with each board and includes card data within each list. This nested inclusion 
retrieves all cards within each retrieved board's lists.
include: { user: true } includes information about the user who owns each board.
Overall Logic:

Find all active boards (active: true).
Apply OR condition: include boards that are either public (public: true) or owned 
by the user identified by owner_id.
Sort the retrieved boards by their last updated timestamp (descending).
Include related lists for each board, and within each list, include all cards.
Include information about the user who owns each board.
Additional Notes:

Make sure owner_id is defined correctly to avoid unexpected results.
Consider potential performance implications of eager loading all cards and user data. 
If you don't need all this information immediately, you could implement lazy loading mechanisms.
Remember data sensitivity: Publicly exposing user information might require additional 
security measures depending on your application's context
